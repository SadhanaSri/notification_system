# notification_system
Simple notification system using PHP, JAVASCRIPT and AJAX. 

<h3>ABOUT</h3>
  AJAX opens a wide range of possibilities to developers. One of them is periodic pinging of database and check for changes to the data. It is certainly not a new technique and developers achieved it in the past using JavaScript and XMLHTTP. This project is a possible approach for notifying the end user of any changes made to the database. The notifications are displayed in a popup to catch the attention of the user as like facebook notifications. MySql database is used for effective workflow control.
  
<h3>WORKFLOW</h3>
  login.php - The user is logged in using his/her login credentials. They are validated.
  notification.php - The authorized user is redirected to this page where the specific notifications are displayed in realtime by setting the interval to constantly refresh the ID after 1 second(1000ms).
  data.php - used to fetch the notification details when the user clicks the bell button.
